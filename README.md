The calculate_sample_size function is a Python function that takes in several inputs and returns the total sample size needed to achieve a desired level of accuracy. The inputs to the function include:

- alpha: The significance level for the hypothesis test, typically set to 0.05.
- power: The desired statistical power for the hypothesis test, typically set to 0.8 or 0.9.
- effect_size: The expected effect size of the predictor, estimated in previous studies. The effect size represents the strength of the relationship between the predictor and the outcome variable.
- n_binary: The number of binary predictors in the model.
- n_cat: The number of categorical predictors in the model.
- n_cont: The number of continuous predictors in the model.

The function first calculates the Z-values for the desired significance level and power using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution. These values are then used to calculate the required sample size for a single predictor variable using the formula:

                                           n_base = (z_alpha + z_power)^2 / effect_size^2
                                          
where z_alpha and z_power are the Z-values for the desired significance level and power, respectively. This formula is based on the standard formula for calculating sample size for a two-sample t-test.

The function then adjusts the sample size for the number of binary, categorical and continuous predictors using the formula:

                                          n_adjusted = n_base / (n_binary + n_cat + n_cont + 1)
                                         
where n_binary, n_cat and n_cont are the number of binary, categorical and continuous predictors in the model, respectively. This formula takes into account the fact that more predictors in the model can increase the required sample size.

Finally, the adjusted sample size is rounded up to the nearest integer using the ceil function and returned as the output of the function.

The code also includes an example of how to use the calculate_sample_size function. The example sets the alpha and power values to 0.05 and 0.8, respectively, and estimates the effect size based on previous studies. The number of binary, categorical and continuous predictors in the model are set to 10, 4 and 0, respectively. The effect size is then adjusted for the number of variables using Cohen's f-squared method, and the calculate_sample_size function is called to calculate the required sample size.
